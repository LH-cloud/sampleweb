          <p>The United States and Iran have been stuck in a stupid game of chicken.

Leaders of both countries say they want to restore the Iran nuclear deal to its original state: with the U.S. as a member and Iran in full compliance with its strictures. But both sides want the other to go first. Tehran has asked Washington to drop the sanctions former President Donald Trump reimposed after leaving the pact in 2018, and Washington demands Tehran return to compliance before sanctions are revoked.

On Monday, however, Iran proposed a new way forward: Let the European Union, another party to the deal, manage a simultaneous return. The U.S. could re-enter the agreement, nixing sanctions per its terms, while Iran resumes compliance at the same time. Bafflingly, the Biden administration said no.
